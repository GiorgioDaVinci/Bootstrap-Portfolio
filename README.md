# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

The Bootstrap portfolio was made using bootstrap. This was done to reduce the amount of css logic that is written to make a website responsive. In essence, bootstrap is a css framework that was used to reduce the number of media queries written to make a website responsive. 

Bootsrap makes it possible for a website to be repsonsive and saves the developer time that would have been used to write media queries for responsiveness.

There is a drop down menu on the navigation bar under the work section where the user can click and be redirected to the web pages where the projects are located on a new tab. This makes it easier for the user to navigate between pages.
